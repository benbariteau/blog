One of the big problems with "top 10 of <previous year>" is that usually that year _just_ ended. Sometimes it's nice to see what stands the test of time. In that spirit, I'm going to go back 10 years and pick my top 10 of 2009. A few nice things about this: 1) I've had 10 years to let the movies sit, a few months difference doesn't really matter; 2) I've had 10 years to catch up on movies I missed in theaters; 3) I can post this any time!

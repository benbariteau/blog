Flags have always been an interest of mine. What makes a good flag is fairly subjective, so I'm gonna throw my metaphorical hat in the ring. Despite the name of this post, I wil also be including US territories.

# Removed from consideration: Georgia and Oklahoma

I've decided two remove these two flags from consideration, the [Flag of Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)) and the [Flag of Oklahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Oklahoma). Both of these flags are just too steeped in cultural and political realities to allow me to give properly consideration on aesthetics alone.

# Ranking

## 52 - Utah

![Flag of Utah](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Flag_of_Utah.svg)

And we start here at the bottom. Utah's flag commits many of the cardinal sins of flag designs: name of the state on the flag, containing other flags (in this case the American flag), being just a seal on a field of blue. But it's also just not very good looking, the draped American flags and eagle just look badly drawn.

## 51 - Illinois

![Flag of Illinois](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Flag_of_Illinois.svg)

The flag of Illinois makes a lot of similar errors to Utah's flag: badly drawn eagle, including the name of the state, and using American flag icongraphy. It also bafflingly decides to write the word "sovreignty" UPSIDE DOWN. Why???

## 50 - North Dakota

![Flag of North Dakota](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Flag_of_North_Dakota.svg)

This flag is quite similar to the last one (and the next one), but just is a bit more artistic.

## 49 - US Virgin Islands

![Flag of the US Virgin Islands](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Flag_of_the_United_States_Virgin_Islands.svg)

This flag is similar to the last three, but edges them out by having a slightly better drawn eagle and settling for initials instead of the full state name.

## 48 - South Dakota

![Flag of South Dakota](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Flag_of_South_Dakota.svg)

This is one of two state flags which manages to put the name of the state on it TWICE, so it's bumped way down here. Otherwise, is the perrenially boring "seal on field of blue". The only mildy positive thing I can say is that this teal is at least slightly distinctive among other state flags.

## 47 - Idaho

![Flag of Idaho](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Flag_of_Idaho.svg)

Like South Dakota, Idaho decided they need the name of the state on the flag twice. It only gets ahead by eschewing the state nickname and having a better drawn flag.

## 46 - Kansas

![Flag of Kansas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Flag_of_Kansas.svg)

This one is as boring as them come: seal on field of blue. Points off for putting the name on the flag and the seal itself is not very well drawn.

## 45 - Montana

![Flag of Montana](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Flag_of_Montana.svg)

Not much to say here, only slightly better than Kansas because it lacks the crappy looking flower, leaving only a badly drawn seal and the name of the state.

## 44 - Wisconsin

![Flag of Wisconsin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Flag_of_Wisconsin.svg)

Wisconsin is as boring as they come, but has a decent looking seal to edge out Montana.

## 43 - Delaware

![Flag of Delaware](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Flag_of_Delaware.svg)

Delaware gets points in my book for mixing up the colors and composition with the diamond and non-blue background. Dumping the date would make this flag significantly better, but still probably solidly middle of the pack.

## 42 - Minnesota

![Flag of Minnesota](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Minnesota.svg)

A kind of busy seal, unfrotunately including the state name. The motto "L'etoile d nord" meaning "The Star of the North" is appropriate for the state, so I like it.

## 41 - Nebraska

![Flag of Nebraska](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Flag_of_Nebraska.svg)

Extremely generic, but the choice of only a few colors makes it work a bit better.

## 40 - New Hampshire

![Flag of New Hampshire](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Flag_of_New_Hampshire.svg)

Seal-on-blue, but the little extra border around it is nice.

## 39 - West Virginia

![Flag of West Virginia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Flag_of_West_Virginia.svg)

Another generic seal flag with the name of the state, but the blue border is fairly distinctive at least.

## 38 - Maine

![Flag of Maine](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Flag_of_Maine.svg)

Seal-on-blue, but seal has some neat "easter eggs". I like the guy leaning on the anchor and the moose just chillin'.

## 37 - Vermont

![Flag of Vermont](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Flag_of_Vermont.svg)

This flag gets a bit of a pass for having the name of the state on the flag for making it tastefully small. A bit of "don't dead open inside" going on with "Freedom Vermont and Unity", but otherwise decent looking, if generic, flag.

## 36 - Nevada

![Flag of Nevada](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Flag_of_Nevada.svg)

Nevada's composition is fairly different and its design much less busy than a lot of flags, which is nice. The composition is a bit of double edged sword though, as it makes the flag feel _very_ blue. If it were a different color it would probably be fine, but as is, it makes it blend even more with the other fields of blue.

## 35 - Arkansas

![Flag of Arkansas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Flag_of_Arkansas.svg)

Arkansas went overboard on the stars, but unlike most of the previous flags it at least feels distinctive. The colors and the composition feel singular, which does a lot for this flag.

## 34 - Guam

![Flag of Guam](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Flag_of_Guam.svg)

This one gives enough of a twist of seal-on-blue (even with its name on it) that I kinda like it. The distinctive shape of the seal is nice, plus the red border.

## 33 - Iowa

![Flag of Iowa](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Flag_of_Iowa.svg)

This design feels distinctive within its domain (even if I bit too close to the French flag). The slogan is a bit overlong and the inclusion of the name of the state docks it, but it's at least relatively recognizable.

## 32 - Connecticut

![Flag of Connecticut](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Flag_of_Connecticut.svg)

No more state name anymore, finally. The motto on the ribbon "Qui transtulit sustinet" means "He who transplants sustains", which is a prett good motto, so I'm happy to see it here on the flag.

## 31 - Florida

![Flag of Florida](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Flag_of_Florida.svg) 

The seal on... a non-solid color background! Awesome! Alabama's flag is very similar and much simpler, but this flag is still pretty solid. And even though it has the name of the state, since it's in the seal and therefore better integrated into the composition, I give it a pass.

## 30 - Pennsylvania

![Flag of Pennsylvania](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Flag_of_Pennsylvania.svg)

The only thing preventing this from feeling exceptionally generic is the kickass horses, so some points for that. Not much else to say here.

## 29 - New York

![Flag of New York](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Flag_of_New_York.svg)

This feels even more "heraldric" than Pennsylvania and "EXCELSIOR" is cool to see on a flag. But still a seal-on-blue.

## 28 - New Jersey

![Flag of New Jersey](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Flag_of_New_Jersey.svg)

I like the seal on the New York flag a _bit_ better, but using a different background color goes a long way to make this flag way more distinctive.

## 27 - Louisiana

![Flag of Louisiana](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Flag_of_Louisiana.svg)

I like that they chose one single image of the mother pelican with a slighly different shade of blue than other flags. Not amazing, but I'll take it.

## 26 - Oregon

![Flag of Oregon (obverse)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Flag_of_Oregon.svg)
![Flag of Oregon (reverse)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Flag_of_Oregon_%28reverse%29.svg)

First: this is the only flag with two sides in this list. And yes, this does have the name of the state on it. However, the reverse side is just sublime. If this were the flag alone, It would probably be in the top 10. However, the obverse side is exceedlying generic and doing all sorts of bad stuff, so it only gets to be here in the middle of the pack.

## 25 - Massachusetts

![Flag of Massachusetts](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Flag_of_Massachusetts.svg)

Solidly "heraldric" with the motto of "Ense Petit Placidam, Sub Liberte Quietem" meaning "By the Sword We Seek Pecae, But Peace Only Under Liberty" which kinda owns. Lotta points for white background instead of blue.

## 24 - American Samoa

![Flag of American Samoa](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Flag_of_American_Samoa.svg)

Distinctive, if a bit generic, design. Not much to say.

## 23 - Flag of Hawaii

![Flag of Hawaii](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Flag_of_Hawaii.svg)

This flag is frankly kinda bonkers, but I appreciate how distinctive it is. The inclusion of the union flag as part of it is unfortunately common but a practice I'm not a big fan of. That being said, The weirdness adds to the distinctiveness, which is a huge plus.

## 22 - North Carolina

![Flag of North Carolina](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Flag_of_North_Carolina.svg)

Solid, simple design. Unfortunately very similar to the (even simpler) Texas flag, but the inclusion of the state's initials and a couple dates pull it down pretty significantly in comparison. That being said this is the first one on the list I'd call actually good.

## 21 - Missouri

![Flag of Missouri](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Flag_of_Missouri.svg)

Solid, simple design. "Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto" means "the health of the people should be the supreme law", which is great. Simple improvements here is reduce the number of stars and stick with one motto instead of two.

## 20 - Washington

![Flag of Washington](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Flag_of_Washington.svg)

Seal-on-solid-color is generic, but Washington manages to do it with flair. First, a distinctive background color goes a long way. Second, the seal being just George Washington's bust makes it memorable. Points off for including the name of the state on the flag.

## 19 - Virginia

![Flag of Virginia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Flag_of_Virginia.svg)

Seal-on-blue isn't great, but holy shit what a seal. "Sic Semper Tyrannis" plus standing over a toppled king, that shit owns.

## 18 - Rhode Island

![Flag of Rhode Island](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Flag_of_Rhode_Island.svg)

Simple, distinctive design. The nearly square shape is also distinctive. Only improvements would be reducing the number of stars here.

## 17 - Northern Mariana Islands

![Flag of Northern Mariana Islands](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Flag_of_the_Northern_Mariana_Islands.svg)

A pretty design invoking symbols that represent the native peoples of this island. The star--meant to represent the US--is not very well placed and the blue background is a bit too generic. However, overall good design.

## 16 - District of Columbia

![Flag of the District of Columbia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Flag_of_the_District_of_Columbia.svg)

Solid, simple design. Relatively distinctive among state/territory flags. It's got good enough iconography to be able to adapted into different forms as well, the hallmark of a good design.

## 15 - Alabama

![Flag of Alabama](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Flag_of_Alabama.svg)

Simple, distinctive. A bit on the "standard" side, vexillogically speaking, but still very different than other state flags. Solid flag.

## 14 - Indiana

![Flag of Indiana](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Flag_of_Indiana.svg)

Dinsctively, simple design. I even give it a pass for putting the state name on the flag, though it's well integrated enough that I really don't mind.

## 13 - Mississippi

![Flag of Mississippi](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Flag_of_Mississippi_%28%22New_Magnolia_Flag%22%29.svg)

This flag is basically the reason why I did this whole post, as it just was introduced recently. And I gotta say, it's a pretty good flag! The magnolia blossom is a good central focus for the flag, as well as the design being somewhat distinctive among other state flags in general with the two columns of red. Good flag!

## 12 - Wyoming

![Flag of Wyoming](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Flag_of_Wyoming_by_Verna_Keays.jpg)

Great stuff all around here: relatively unique composition with the border colors and the silhouette of the bison feels very "Wyoming". The off-center seal is the only weird choice, but it's mostly fine.

## 11 - Texas

![Flag of Texas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Flag_of_Texas.svg)

The Texas flag is known all over the world, for good reason. It's simple and distinctive. My only complaint is that it feels a bit too similar to the American flag.

## 10 - California

![Flag of California](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Flag_of_California.svg)

Another quality, disinctive flag. Each element of this has been endlessly remixed with the fundamental design remaining recognizable. Even the inclusion of the "California Republic" is normally bad, but works fine here.

## 9 - Ohio

![Flag of Ohio](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Flag_of_Ohio.svg)

Tons of points here for a non-standard flag shape, increasing its destinctiveness by a ton. It's also just different enough from the standard set of American flag elements to be it's own thing, but a change of colors or iconography would make this flag even better.

## 8 - Colorado

![Flag of Colorado](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Flag_of_Colorado_designed_by_Andrew_Carlisle_Carson.svg)

A unique, simple, distinctive flag. It's also easy to remix in other formats. Great flag.

## 7 - Puerto Rico

![Flag of Puerto Rico](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Flag_of_Puerto_Rico.svg)

Simple and distinctive. No criticisms or caveats. Just a great flag.

## 6 - Alaska

![Flag of Alaska](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Flag_of_Alaska.svg)

Using a constellation is such a genius move I'm kinda jealous! This flag very dinstinctive for that reason, which is why it's so high up. I kinda wish they'd gone full black on white so this didn't have such a common color scheme, though.

## 5 - Tennesee

![Flag of Tennesee](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Flag_of_Tennessee.svg)

As yes, the three star dragonball. Simple, distinctive design. Really not much to say here other than it just _works_.

## 4 - Arizona

![Flag of Arizona](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Flag_of_Arizona.svg)

What a flag. The abstract sunset is immediately recognizable, evoking Arizona's westerliness. The only complaint I have is that the copper star doesn't contrast very well with the red sun rays.

## 3 - Maryland

![Flag of Maryland](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Flag_of_Maryland.svg)

This flag is incredible. Simple, clear design that can be adapted to other formats and often is. It feels "heraldric" without sacrificing the good aspects of flag design that make it distinctive when looking at it up on flagpole.

## 2 - South Carolina

![Flag of South Carolina](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Flag_of_South_Carolina.svg)

Two distinctive symbols, well composed together into an even more distinctive flag. No fluff, no chaff. Again, the blue background could be swapped out for another color to great effect, but this one is near perfect.

## 1 - New Mexico

![Flag of New Mexico](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg)

The monarch of state flags. Disinctive color choices, singular abstract symbol that can be (and has been) used in different contexts and be fully understood. This is probably my favorite flag of any that I have ever seen.

# Conclusion

There's some good flags here, but a lot of them leave a lot to be desired. The motivation behind replacing Mississippi's flag is unrelated to aesthetics (looking at you still Georgia) but it did give the state a chance to make their flag much better aesthetically as well. I think other states should give a long hard look at their flags and see if they can come up with something better or improve what they have.

Nobody makes 'em like John Woo and as you might expect the action here is top-notch. Tons of slo-mo, jumping through the air whilst firing guns, great explosions. In short, all the classics. A nice touch is that giving Van Damme a mullet means his dynamic movement in slo-mo is further accentuated.

However, the story is pretty meh. You'd think that rich people hunting the homeless would be compelling but for some reason they decided not to make it personal _at all_ for our hero. This is even directly acknowledged in the finale where Chance Bourdreaux (Van Damme) says, "Poor people get bored too". The story would be somewhat forgivable if outside of a couple opening action scenes, the first half is very action-lite feeling a bit like a boring episode of Law and Order.

A side note: Wilford Brimley trying to do a Cajun accent feels offensive.

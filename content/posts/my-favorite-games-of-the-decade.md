This list has 20 entries because it's a big decade and I couldn't bring myself to leave any one of these out. I just have to say something about every one of these. Also, it should be noted that I haven't played several games from the last decade yet (I only played 3 games from 2019 in 2019 lol), so if a game isn't on this list and you think it should, there's a good chance I didn't play it.

# 20. Red Dead Redemption
"GTA as a western" is pretty accurate. I don't think there's anything paritcularly spectacular about this game on the surface. It's got stock characters and a familiar structure to any Rockstar fan. But it's able to tell an affecting story where you really care about the characters in it. On top of that, it puts so much craft into the world it creates, feeling so alive. It's not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination, but it is an exceptional one nonetheless.
# 19. Sleeping Dogs
"GTA as a Jon Woo film" is pretty accurate. But again, the character work (by a different studio) is really exceptional. The duality presented of being a cop and a criminal is felt despite its stock gameplay. The gameplay itself is fairly standard, save for one fairly revolutionary mechanic: the action hijack. While driving, you can press a button to jump from your car to another one and hijack it like you are the protagonist in your own Hong Kong action movie. Open world games are a dime a dozen these days, but Sleeping Dogs made me want to stick around after the credits rolled.
# 18. DOOM (2016)
I never really played the original Doom games, despite playing many of the "doom clone" genre. Doom nonetheless has dominated the conversations about how shooters--as well as games in general--are seen in popular culture. I wasn't sure that I'd enjoy this game, since I'm usually more interested in much more story-focused games. However, despite its trappings, 2016's DOOM does actually have an actual story. It's fairly thin, but it appropriately leans on the fourth wall, using the franchise's pop culture impact to make the setting more mythic. Plus, the return to form of the strafing, powerup-laden, and brutal gameplay is a welcome refresher in the atmosphere of games following from the lineage of Call of Duty.
# 17. Spider-Man
If there's anything that this decade has had enough of, it's open world games. Despite this, I found myself hunting down every last little random trinket in this game. Like the Arkham series before it, Spider-Man uses the rich history of the character to make collectibles and unlockables much more interesting. Like its spiritual successor, the movie tie-in Spider-Man 2, this game makes the very act of controlling Spider-Man extremely fun. I found myself not wanting to fast travel just so I could swing some more. In a much more visceral way, this game also follows in the footsteps of the Arkham games in terms of its comat. However, the combat is significantly more refined, with the iterated rock-paper-scissors mechanics being honed to a find edge. I always felt myself on the edge of my comptency, reveling in just barely making it through. The characters are very well realized, if a bit underdeveloped. The story itself is well done, but still comes a bit lacking. But the gameplay makes up for most of those faults.
# 16. Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag
Black Flag is unlike any Assassin's Creed game before or since (even the mostly a clone Rogue). Living out a Carribean pirate adventure is one of the most viscerally satisfying things I've experienced. The thrill of each ecounter with an enemy ship is not quite anything else. The iteration on the gameplay of the rest of the series melds into a cohesive whole. Plus you get to dig for buried treasure! The story leaves a lot to be desired, starting the series as a whole down an unending meta-narratve path that will only resolve when the series stops making money or they decided to reboot it. Luckily its DLC adventure, Freedom Cry, delivers on meaningful context in spades. Despite its weak spots, Black Flag still remains an experience like no other.
# 15. Deus Ex: Human Revolution
Deus Ex is one of the few games I've played that has actually delivered on the promise of feeling like you're actually having a real conversation where you can actually convince people. This combined with its focused stealth gameplay made this game an instant classic. Plus you get to do a bank heist! The hacking minigame somehow both feels accurate and is also an extremely compelling game in itself. It's both tactical and requires speed, plus it encourages risk taking. The little mystery box story isn't as satisfying as the philosophical debate it contains, but it does the job. The visual of this game are big part of what's so iconic about it, though. It wraps up the whole thing in a golden, hexagonal bow.
# 14. TIS-100
To paraphrase a steam review of this game: "there's nothing like coming home from a long day programming to do MORE PROGRAMMING". It's not really easy to describe why I like to program fake assembly other than to say I like progamming real assembly as well. It's crazy to me that this game even exists, since it feels like it was made for me alone. This is the only game since I left school that I pulled an all nighter for. I didn't even have a good reason, I just really wanted to figure out the puzzle.
# 13. Dishonored
Dishonored is both familiar and innovative. The setting is one of the most interesting steampunk/fantasy settings I've seen in years. Blink alone is worth the price of admission, completely changing the way that stealth games like this are played. Each level feels like a puzzle box where planning, reflexes, and creativity all congeal into a huge amount of fun.
# 12. The Stanley Parable
The Stanley Parable is a gamer's game. It pokes the same part of my brain that loves Community. Everything about the game is designed to screw with your idea of what a game can be. It's one of the few things where I can say that watching the trailers is actually a big part of the experience. Playing The Stanley Parable feels like peeking behind the curtain to see even more curtains.

I doubt I'm breaking new ground here, but I thought it was mediocre to fine. I think the base concept isn't terrible, but since the main plot a complete rehash of the first movie, it feels exceptionally cheap. I think simply using a new villain would have worked better for this movie.

The performances are good and pretty much all of the leads are at least decently compelling. As much as I hate to admit it the nostalgic moments largely gave me chills.

Another thing that felt kinda bad and I feel like could have been worked out better is the "reunion" between Egon and his daughter (the mom). Leaving aside the actor puppet (which its amazing to get so literally ghoulish), on a pure story level it felt exceptionally unearned.

The sequel hook thing feels like it's going to give us a lot more backwards looking stuff. Honestly a third Gozer movie seems likely unless they decide to rehash Ghostbusters II. Not sure which is a worse idea.

All in all I don't regret watching it but also it was a movie that probably was better off not being made.

For decades now, the debate on whether or not "video games are art" has raged.
I'm not really interested in rehashing those arguments, but I think the comparison is important to understand.
Regardless of the "art-ness" (or lack thereof) of video games, they are undeniably _entertainment_.
And, well, entertainment is part of culture.
So, the way I see it, even if video games "aren't" "art" it's kinda moot given that as a society we generally think that culture is worth preserving.
And video games are one of the worst preserved mediums of culture and it's not close.

According to wikipedia, the _Mona Lisa_ was painted c. 1503-1506 (over 500 years ago).
I've never seen it person, but it's just a plane ride away.
On the same wikipedia page I can view a digital image of it.
It's such a ubiquitous image that even if it say, was burned up, it wouldn't really be "lost".

_Romeo and Juliet_ premiered in 1597 (over 400 years ago).
I can pick up a copy of the play easily at any bookstore or my local library.
A local theater near you probably has a production of it right this minute.

During my freshman year of college in March 2010 (13 years ago), Battlefield: Bad Company 2 was released.
In April of this year, the game was removed from sale on all digital platforms.
The developer, DICE, claims this is because they are shutting down the servers associated with this game.
However, plenty of games with multiplayer components that have shut down the servers are still available for sale.
Battlefield: Bad Company 2's singleplayer mode was well reviewed, albiet maybe not the best the medium has to offer.

Battlefield: Bad Company 2 isn't the _best_ example, since as a popular triple-A release many physical copies were created.
Looking on ebay today, you can pick one up for about $10.
But as time goes on fewer copies will be available so either the price will increase or the availability will drop off.
Will this game be playable in 500 years?

Now I won't pretend to be an archival expert.
We certainly don't have every piece of culture from hundreds of years ago.
It's hard to predict the exact fraction, but it's probably less than 1%.
Even with that in mind, video games are abysmally bad.
For every detail that Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has--physical release, popularity, ability to be played alone--a removal of one or more makes the ability to play a given game that much less.

So let's talk about physical releases.
It wasn't until quite recently that digital releases were even possible.
The seventh gen consoles--the PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii--all had their own digital storefronts.
This is when digital releases hit the mainstream, not even 20 years ago (the Xbox 360 was released in November 22nd, 2005).
At this time, titles released digitally on console were almost entirely separate from ones that got physical releases.

This would change with the next console generation.
In the eigth generation--PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, and Switch--digital distribution became ubiquitious.
Going forward, every game available physically is also available digitally.
Notably, the reverse is not always true[^1].

The ninth generation--the current one--has codified this physically.
The Xbox Series S and PS5 Digital Edition lack the disc drives required to play physical releases.
If one so chooses, you can forgo the ability to play games this way; this has broad enough appeal they've released alternate editions of their consoles to serve the niche.

Now this entire time I've been talking about consoles.
There's another way to play video games: on PC.
As a more continuous platform, the PC doesn't have generations in the same way.
But at some point in the past[^2], there stopped being "true" physical releases on PC.
For a while, you could still buy a box in the store, but when you put the disc in your PC, it would just prompt you install Steam or somesuch.
And now even that vestige is gone.

It's only a matter of time until the physical release goes the way of the dodo entirely.
But maybe you say, "Who cares? You can still get any game you want digitally."
But let's circle back to Battlefield: Bad Company 2.
You _can't_ get it digitally now.
You can still buy it physically from resellers, sure.
But once physical release goes away, the ability to play a game could be taken away at a moment's notice.

"Well if you want to play it," says my hypothetical objector, "Why didn't you buy it when it was available?"
That's a great idea in theory but there's two issues.
First, there's a limit to the amount of money I have for entertainment.
I'm not going to pick up every game in the off chance I might play it[^3].
Second, what about people who weren't able to buy the game during the time it was available for purchase digitally?
People will in fact continue to be born and may be interested to experience culture from before the moment of their birth.

I've been dancing around it for a while so let's address the elephant in the room: piracy.
I think piracy does mitigate a lot of the problems I brought up here, but it's far from a perfect solution.
It largely gets rid of the purchase cost issue, as well as the publisher "allowing" it to be made available as prerequisite for playing a game.
However, pirating games is always going to have the downside of being illegal.
I know some people scoff at that criticism, but ultimately if your experience of culture requires breaking the law--no matter how nonviolent--many will not cross that line.

On a more practical note, piracy is a skill that many aren't willing to cultivate.
Navigating the scam- and virus-laden waters of modern piracy is far from accessible.
Not to mention the inherent issue of getting a pirated copy of a video game installed can often be an ordeal compared to piracy of other mediums; pressing play on an .mkv of a movie is always going to be a simpler experience than installing an illegitimate copy of a game.

Which leads me to the next issue which is a bit of the crux of all of this.
Video games are software.
I know, shocker.
And the thing about software is that it's very finnicky about the environment it will run in.
Emulation is notoriously difficult and as games get more complex that will only get worse.
So, ultimately, I kinda _get_ why these companies don't want to support these games forever.

Movie studios have it much easier.
If you need to switch mediums every decade at most, with each conversion being relatively standard and simple[^4].
I don't think it would be reasonable to ask every developer to support their games in perpetuity.
But what's happening now is letting culture die.

So how do we fix this?
I wish I had a simple, reasonable, achievable fix.
But unfortunately it mostly looks like it's gonna get worse unless some legislators start getting really cool about stuff real fast.
So let's talk pie in the sky.

First and foremost, codify emulation as protected beyond a shadow of a doubt.
Recently, Nintendo has been pushing back hard on a popular emulator for GameCube and Wii games, Dolphin.
They've attempted to strongarm the developers to prevent people from using the open source emulator.
The developers have rightly pointed out that the DMCA--which Nintendo is claiming they violate--has clear exemptions for tools like emulators.
However--as with many things--oftentimes the side with the most threatening lawyers (i.e. money) will win the day.
If an important jurisdiction--I'd like the US to do this but EU doing it would help a lot--legislates or ejudicates this fact so that companies will stop trying to strongarm people, that would help the situation greatly.

Another thing I'd like to see is some kind of legal requirement to make a reasonable effort to make games available to the general public, even if that form isn't necessarily easy to play.
I'll admit I'm on much shakier ground here; typically compelling actions in this way is not expected.
And in fact there's probably a lot of jurisprudence to suggest that holding a copyrighted work without making it available is a fairly "enshirned" right.
However, I think that this is at the root of the problem.
Granted it's related to the ability to do this easily, but I think that if at least games had to be available in _some form_ playing them could be a surmountable problem.

Like I said, pie in the sky.
I'm pretty afraid that most people won't notice this being a problem until it's too late to save a lot of games.
Maybe we'll never get enough people to care such that something gets done about it.
I'm not terribly optimistic about this situation.

All that said, let's talk harm reduction.
The first thing to remember is that the most important thing is that you can play a game.
Even if it's not for all time.

A thing I've been doing lately is asking my library to buy games.
If I get them to buy a game that I know is worth keeping then maybe someone in the future will play it.
There's a ton of caveats to this.
Chiefly is that a lot of libraries don't have video games whatsoever[^5].
Also, even if they do they might only buy games that are new releases for current-ish console generation.
They might only buy for one console and not all of them.
But it's still worth doing and something an individual can do, for free no less.

I know a spent a lot of this essay decrying digital-only releases, but realistically it is actually effective at allow distribution way after a physical release is out of print.
And my personal favorite PC digital storefront has gotta be GOG.
Their selection of new releases isn't nearly as good, due to their strict DRM-free requirement; it turns out that many publishers won't put many of their games on such a platform.
However, the old expansion of "GOG" was "Good Old Games" due to their penchant of releasing old games with patches to make them work on modern PCs.
GOG has a "wishlist" forum where users can suggest games to be added to the collection.
This is a good starting point, but I assume most of the releases involve business deals between GOG and publishers.
Regardless, I'm happy their out their doing their thing.

The juggernaut of PC digital storefronts is of course Steam.
Recently, Activision Blizzard King--ahead of their acquisition by Microsoft--will start bringing their games to Steam.
There's a _lot_ of caveats to Valve's benevolent dictatorship[^6] of PC gaming, but for now being the place where you can buy nearly every game released since c. 2010 on PC is nothing to wag a finger at.
I still buy any game I can find on GOG instead of Steam, but that still leaves a sizeable heap of games I can only reasonably find on Steam; there are much worse fates.

Ultimately, I don't really have any answers.
I just want more people to care.
And hopefully if more people care someday things will get better.

[^1]: Limited Run games does their part to prevent this from being true forever, and I salute them.
[^2]: I honestly couldn't remember when this happened, but cursory googling says around 2010?
[^3]: Not to mention storage space, which is also constrained by money.
[^4]: Not to trivialize the work of AV engineers who do digitizations and preservation. Software maintenance and porting is just really hard.
[^5]: This makes me mad, but that's a rant for another time.
[^6]: If there's one thing to learn it's that on the long arc of history, all corporations become money grubbing bastards.

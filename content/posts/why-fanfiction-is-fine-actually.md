Fanfiction gets a real bad rap.
Professional writers (and their fans) often malign fanfictoin writers, usually for perceived violation of their authorial control or purported belief that writing fanfiction isn't "real writing".
In wider culture, fanfiction often has many negative perceptions, such as being the product of immature or sexual deviant minds (or both).
However, it remains a popular pastime for many fans of the original works (both writers and readers).
And so I'm going to tell you why it's fine, actually.

Disclaimer: I don't really read any fanfiction and in the past have held some negative views of people who read or write fanfiction.

# Actual problems with fanfiction

Fanfiction, like most human endeavors, isn't perfect.
In order to get it out of the way, I'm going to go into some of thw ways that it has legitimate problems!
Disclaimer for this section is that most of this is based on understanding from other people and some of it may be out of date.

A common type of fanfiction is so-called "slash", which is sexually explicit fanfiction containing male-male pairings[^1], oftentimes written by cis women.
Issue has been taken by some people with cis women fetishizing gay relationships and sex.
The discourse around this is very complex and I honestly have no stake in it so I'm not going to delve into questions of its legitimacy as a criticism, but I felt it needed pointing out.

The fanfiction community is deeply split on a more general issue: whether or not it's acceptable to write fiction involving scenarios that people find objectionable.
Example of this are things like emotional and physical abuse, coercion, sexual assault, and many others.
Some people in the community are willing to self-curate for anything they find objectionable, while others find the production of those works entirely unacceptable.
Again, I have no stake in this, so I'm not going to weigh in on it.

# What is "real writing"?

This is kind of a huge topic, but it's also one of the most legitimate-sounding criticisms of fanfiction as whole.
Namely, that by taking the characters and setting of another work, you are stymying your own creativity in creating art.
I'm gonna tell you why that's bullshit.

First, and most straightforwardly, creating derivative works that you didn't originally write is incredibly common _as a professional writer_.
There's so many forms of this, I'm just gonna make bulleted list:
- Comic books that have been going for decades have no choice but to eventually replace writers for their series, but oftentimes do it within only a few years of their original run.
  "So-and-so" is doing a run on \<insert your favorite superhero here\> is practically expected by now.
- Adapations of existing works.
  Hell, the Oscars have a whole category for recognizing adaptational writing.
- Large series that take contributions from many authors. Sometimes these are even ghost written as a "single" author to give the illusion of this not happening.
- Reboots of existing properties oftentimes don't have original creators involved for one reason or another.

A very similar situation to above is when elements of other works are effectively copied into something new.
This is very common with popular, iconic characters.
Here's some examples:
- The comic book Irredeemable most prominently copies the idea of Superman into a work and basically tries to answer the question, "What if Superman started murdering people?".
  The story wouldn't work as intended if they didn't reimagine Superman (in this case called the Plutonian) and the fictional stuff around him.

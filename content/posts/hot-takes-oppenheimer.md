Overall good! This feels like extremely restrained for Nolan, but it still has his flair. Visually I like how he's taken his obsession with visualizing physics stuff and turned into a motif for this film. It finally feels like he's figured out how to use sound too! Very good layering and use of volume, and yet the dialogue is still always understandable.

Murphy, Blunt, and Downey do an excellent job. Murphy is really giving the performance of a lifetime. You really see all the nuances of Oppenheimer's state of mind over the years. Downey's late heel turn is a thing of beauty. Blunt has so few scenes but does so much with it.

My biggest complaint is that the ensemble is just so huge. Either it needed to really pare down the number of characters or figure out more efficient ways of characterizing them. There's a ton of people who have scenes that I couldn't remember their names. This is one of the challenges in adopting a real life like this. I still think that issue is fairly minor given the weight of the good stuff here.

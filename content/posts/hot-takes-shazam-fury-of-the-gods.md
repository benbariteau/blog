This movie is a mess. The plot itself feels super cheap overall, since it takes a fairly rational decision from the first movie and turns it into an apocalyptic mistake. There's a few decent actual beats but even if you take everything at face value character motivations feel really weak.

They push a character arc super clumsily for Billy that just kinda resolves with no actual work. Essentially setup in the intro and resolution at the climax where I guess he has a sudden epiphany.

Freddie and the wizard have a bit of a fun odd couple thing in the middle of the movie. Darla once again steals the show by just being so charming and having a fun bit where she tames some unicorns. Both are pretty thin but they're pretty much the only charming parts of the movie.

The plot point about Billy aging out of the system is weird because a) we already know that Mary still lives in the foster home l, b) it's just a sitcom not talking to each other plot, and c) IDK why Freddie isn't involved in this given he's very close in age to Billy. I think they were trying to wrap up Billy not calling Rosa "mom" into this as well but it ultimately feels like a missing thread.

I'm glad they finally revealed their superhero identities to their parents because it was feeling pretty silly otherwise.

As always the mid and post credits scenes are more frustrating than interesting. The Justice Society thing is... bad. It's just a wet fart of a reveal. Relying on mostly TV characters makes it worse. The post credit scene is at least kind of a meta-joke about these kind of scenes but it doesn't make it any more interesting.

The Pedro coming out moment is... weird. I guess at this point this is part of the texture of these kinds of things but it's just extremely surface level.

The fact that we get two face turns seems like too much. I see from plot mechanics and characterization why they did it, but it still feels cheap.

The "climax" of this movie was super long. I checked my watch several times during this and I'm fairly certain the apocalypse trigger that begins the sequence is literally an hour before the end of the film. That's too much time! Throwing every Greek myth monster into there felt like a waste too.

The whole "Philly Fiascos" thing is weird too. It's another thing that doesn't actually have a true resolution, just a random epiphany. It's wrapped up in the name thing which to be fair is a problem from the comics, but that they could have fixed in this adaptation imo. After a while meta humor gets stale too.

And then the big tamale... Wonder Woman. The I assume the horniness comes from trying to write teens, but it feels really gross anyway. And her as a deus ex machina (fairly literally) is bad and another reason why these shared universes often lead to bad films.

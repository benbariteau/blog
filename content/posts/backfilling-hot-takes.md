I'm doing something kinda weird, and I figured I should spell it out. For a... while? I've been creating short reviews of things I finished watching/reading/playing which I share with friends in a private slack. Some of these over time I adapted into my "Hot Takes" series of blog posts. The first of these being my Hot Take on A Bridge Too Far.

I decided I might as well publish the rest of these hot takes, given that I have many of them saved in Google Keep anyway. Additionally, instead of publishing them all "today", I'm also backdating them to when I wrote them (also conveniently in Google Keep). I'm not sure how far I'll go back, but I've already got one from 2022 I've found. These are going to have minimal to no editing, so may be rougher than my (up to now) typical posts.

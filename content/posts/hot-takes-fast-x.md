Okay first things first... the last scene before the credits has Gal Gadot show up again lmao. Nobody stays dead! And the meta irony of that is that they killed off John Cena after one movie of him in the ensemble. They also implied that Tej, Roman, Han, and Ramsey died (though in a very obvious they-got-away-offscreen way). I don't think any of that is good per se, but it does kinda fit in with the rest of the series at this point.

I kinda like that they dealt with Han and Shaw's whole thing, albeit in a pretty minimal way.

Relatedly, Mia continuing to show up without Brian is funny.

Aimes's character makes no sense with back-to-back heel-face and face-heel turns. I don't expect much from these kinds of movies but it just felt unnecessary.

Tying the plot into Fast 5--arguably still the best entry--doesn't really work in favor of the film. On the other hand, Jason Momoa is having a ton of fun and definitely feels like a unique take on a villain.

The Rome scene felt like it relied too much on happenstance for it to be a meaningful plan. I'm sure there's a TV Tropes variant on the Xanatos Gambit for that.

I can't believe they managed to shoehorn a street race into this movie, but sure why not.

The coup de grace of this movie was definitely using nos to crash helicopters together though.

The cliffhanger was... fine? It felt like a mostly complete movie so I'm not really bothered that it obviously has a part two. Given the ridiculous stakes of the previous sequences it almost felt quaint, though.
Overall it's not the best Fast & Furious, but I had a lot of fun.

Season 4 in many ways is the most Discovery for better and for worse. Season long mystery arc? Check. Everyone getting deeply in touch with their emotions? Check. Pacing a touch too fast to feel right? Check.

Despite all that (or perhaps because of it) I think it still works well. It's definitely not perfect, but it feels like the show has finally, truly found its space legs. The actual plot of this season feels like a timeless Star Trek plot while also breaking new ground for the franchise.

I think the smaller plots with emotional stuff for various characters all felt rushed, as is normal for Discovery. I wish they'd get better about that, but I think it's a symptom of the short seasons, unfortunately.

But all in all, a solid season, which manages to really feel like it earns that title completely for maybe the first time.

I think this might be the best Branaugh Poirot so far. As always, Christie mysteries are some of the best. But as an adaptation, there's a lot of really good details. Firstly, this has the most mood out of the 3 films. Stark lighting, (ostensible) ghost sightings, and interesting camera angles and moves.

The ghost aspect is an interesting one, because it's hard to pull off a hyper-rationalist mystery movie like this while also having a supernatural aspect that is so clearly there (i.e. we _see_ ghosts a couple times). The "Poirot was drugged" plus a few actually explained details solution is decent, albiet a little cheap. I do think that it overall works to set the mood though, so I'm willing to excuse it. Especially since you could read the ghost(s) as real but dismissively irrelevant.

I like how snappy this movie is too! Just over 100 minutes gives the movie a good pace and a feeling of always being on the back foot, while feeling appropriately developed.

Anyway, solid mystery film. No twists like Christie twists done with panache.

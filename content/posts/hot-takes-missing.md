Really solid thriller. Good twists that largely both feel surprising but also not arbitrary. In particular, the dad being an abusive drug dealer was really good.

Definitely overall refined compared to Searching. In particular using the dramatization at the end was such a neat flair. It's also willing to play a little more fast and loose with cutting between screens, which I think helps the pacing.

There were so many good setups with great payoffs, but the Siri one was definitely the best.

I also really enjoyed poking at the modern True Crime Establishment, which didn't exist nearly as much when Searching came out. Definitely feels a bit like an updated take on A Cry in the Dark/Evil Angels in that way.

I definitely could pick some nits but overall I liked it quite a bit.

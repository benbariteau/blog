It's obviously a bit more survival focused than RE4 (2023), which made it more frustrating for me because it took me longer than it should have to realize I could run away from zombies. That's on me and it honestly makes the game much more tense and strategic.

The thing that really blew me away was the level design, though. I _love_ the way the police station is set up. It feels like a big puzzle box where you have to unlock particular doors at particular times, creating these shortcuts but keeping everything at a metered pace. My only complaint is that this sometimes exacerbated some times where I wasn't sure exactly how to proceed. The excuse of the police station being formerly an art gallery is dumb as hell, but I like that they were just like "this place is gonna be extra as _hell_ and we'll just make people deal with it". The fact that you spend so much time navigating the police station before the Tyrant shows up is genius. It makes it feel tense but not unfair. I love that every single section is physically connected is cool as hell. You can even backtrack to the police station up until right before the last section!

The plot is... functional. I kinda wish it had more silly parts tbh? Then it would at least be interesting.

Overall, I liked it quite a bit. Hard to say if I liked it more or less than RE4, but either way it's quite good.

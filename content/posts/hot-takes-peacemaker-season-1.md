Good stuff:
- Characters are pretty good, especially Vigilante
- I like that it was really explicit about politics (at least a chunk of them)
- The scene where Vigilante fucks up white supremacists owned
- Eagly is great

Not-so-good stuff:
- Adebayo's chracter arc was... she should embrace killing people for the government? Because she's good at it (suddenly, with no satisfying explanation)
- The implicit moral of the whole show is that unaccountable black ops operating on american soil needs to exist in case of invasion of the body snatchers. To be fair, a lot of superhero stuff falls into this trap, but this show seems too explicit to not at least try to question that, which is surprising given that The Suicide Squad (also by James Gunn and of which this is a spinoff) did to an extent.
- A lot of plot points are too quickly resolved to feel like anything but red herrings, like Murn being a butterfly, the butterfly's plan being to stop global warming, and Peacemaker not wanting to kill people anymore.
- The attempt to inject pathos into Peacemaker's backstory backfires because it's just too silly to take seriously
- Economos framing Auggie feels like a bad sitcom plot but huge parts of the plot hinge on it and makes them feel cheaper.
- It felt too convenient that all the important locations were in Evergreen, Peacemaker's hometown.
- Vigilante shrugging off the grenade felt unrealistic in the context of the show while also being largely pointless

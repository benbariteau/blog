# 10. Machete

Machete started its life as a [fake trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp_dJkwQAds) (warning, some brief nudity) in Taratino and Rodriguez's double feature Grindhouse. Honestly, these fake trailers were my favorite part of the whole venture (_Death Proof_ is my least favorite Tarantino and _Planet Terror_ is fun, if a bit more fluffy than I'd prefer).

I was ecastic when I heard that the bombastic trailer would be turned into an actual feature length film. And the final product did not disappoint. Nearly every scene in Machete manages to one-up the last one. And by the end of this rollercoaster of a movie, you're still hungry for more.

# 9. Tangled

Mostly remembered as the "proto-Frozen" at this point, Tangled is actually a fun little movie. Despite its moderate twist on a very classic story, it somehow manages to find heart in places you wouldn't expect. The music is downplayed compared to many other Disney films, but what is there is catchy and fun. I just found myself coming back to this movie over and over for some reason I can't really put my finger on, but for that reason alone I have to recommend it.

# 8. The King's Speech

I mean this movie won Best Picture. It's got a stellar cast and it manages to turn the simplest act into a struggle and the ultimate moment of triumph. This movie is all about subtle perfomances by actors at the top of thier games.

# 7. How to Train Your Dragon

I skipped this movie for a few years because I thought it would be a derivative kids movie. Boy, was I wrong. Not only does this have some of the best characterization I've seen in an animated movie, it does such a good job with having a non-human main character than it makes it easy to suspend your disbelief about a world with dragons. The way that the worldbuilding gets threaded into the story seamlessly is truly great. It's just a really fun movie!

# 6. Tucker & Dale vs Evil

Horror-comedy is one of my favorite little genres because I have a hard time with straight up horror, but I find their tropes fasinating. And no other movie plays with those tropes quite as well as _Tucker & Dale_. It knows exactly when to subvert them for great comedy and also just when to play them straight for playing out the story. In a lot of ways, I think of this as kind of the better version of _Cabin in the Woods_.

# 5. The Social Network

Back in 2010, a Sorkin-penned Fincher movie wasn't quite as tired as it is now, but I still find myself coming back to this movie. The [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB95KLmpLR4) alone is a work of art. Honestly, it's golden from the word go, with the first scene containing probably my favorite line the movie (won't spoil it here). Every moment is precision engineered to turn the silicon valley fantasy into a nightmare. Not by changing any of the things that people like about it, but but showing the cost of those things, and the crappiness that is the "Tech Bro Lifestyle". And unfortunately this movie is just as relevant as it was 10 years ago.

# 4. Kick-Ass

Kick-Ass is not age well (there's a huge subplot about the protagnoist pretending to be gay to see the girl he likes naked). However, I still think it's a fun movie. This was Chloe Grace Moretz's breakthrough role and it's a great one. Nicolas Cage's role is practically made for him (lotta great Cage moments in this movie). It's a pretty fun play on superhero tropes, that works just as well as when it was relased.

# 3. Birdemic: Shock and Terror

It feels kinda weird putting this on a "best of" type list, but this is technically "my faves" and I do love this movie. It's bad in almost every way possible. Bad editing, bad acting, bad writing, extremely shoehorned social messaging, and the worst sound you've ever heard on an actual movie. I would say the sound belongs in a YouTube video, but since this movie came out, sound on YouTube videos are much closer to professional than this movie's sound ever was. Oh yeah, and the "special" "effects" are something entirely to behold. Birdemic also has the distinction of having one of the strangest [trailers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy-9YLpC5uM) I've ever seen. Anyway, it's truly one of the funniest bad movies ever made, and if that's your bag, it should be on your list.

# 2. Toy Story 3

I'm almost the perfect age to have seen Toy Story 3 when it came out. I was 19, having just finished my first year in college when this came out, very close in age to Andy's age and trejectory in life. Me and my friend grew up with this series and there was not a dry eye in the house by the time the credits rolled. It was the perfect ending[1] to a modern classic trilogy.

# 1. Megamind

Megamind feels like its more than the sum of its parts. This movie is about casting a classic silver age comic book villian as the protagonist  

[1] Too bad Disney is greedy, huh?

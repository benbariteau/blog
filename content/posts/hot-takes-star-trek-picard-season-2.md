- The overall plot is... fine? A lot of moving parts that it's unclear what's going on, not quite enough oomph to everything.
- Q's motivation seems kinda silly, especially given how this new backstory for Picard never came up. Picard and Q should have kissed.
- I wasn't expecting the followup to Wesley Crusher's plotline lmao. Not terrible all things considered, but also pretty silly.
- "Project Kahn" is both silly and also a contradiction of existing continuity. I guess they'll have to continue retconning Star Trek history as time goes on.
- Tallin was never really explained, I guess she's just an ancestor of Laris?
- Rios plot was well telgraphed, I'll give them that. It's fine as well.
- Jurati's plotline is also quite something. I think it's more interesting, but also feels like a bit of a waste for the actress.
- I wasn't expecting Seven's plotline to coalesce into her actually becoming a Captain. It should have been structured better, but it's a decent turn for the character nonetheless.
- I don't really know why they kept Elnor out of season 2 for the most part?

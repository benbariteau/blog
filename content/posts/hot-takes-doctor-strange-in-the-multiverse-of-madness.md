Good stuff:
- The musical wizard fight was really cool
- Raimi's camera moves are lots of fun
- I laughed when they played the fucking X-men CARTOON theme
- Captain Carter was a neat touch
- I like that they were upfront about America having two moms
- America is a charming character

Bad stuff:
- this whole thing smacks of Brand Management
- Dr. Strange's whole thing seems to be his resistance to character arcs. Both the first movie and this one set one up and then... promptly didn't do shit about them.
- Rachel McAdams feels like she's there for the paycheck. They're not giving her much to work with either though.
- I was able to muddle through but this is obviously dependent on having seen Wandavision for full impact. This plus No Way Home setting it up (kinda), it's just too much stuff.
- other than the one fight above, I thought most of the fights were... meh. still MCU effects fests with too much stuff happening at once
- the last moment before the credits + the mid credits scene were confusing to say the least. I know that it's there to leave stuff open, but they're just leaving out what stuff means anymore, just pretty images
- I wish they'd let Patrick Stewart stop

I think alchemy as a magic system is really neat. I like when magic systems feel like they actually have limits and rules. The "law of equivalent exchange" gives a certain amount of limits which make it feel not arbitrary. It's also cool when they do stuff like break down compounds to gain an upper hand in a fight. They hinted at a deeper structure especially with respect to alkahestry, which wasn't really meaningfully explored, which is my only big complaint in that area.

The characters are all pretty fun and/or interesting. I especially like how they turn Scar from a seemingly one-note villain into someone who gets meaningful character and plot development over the course of the series. I will say that there's a lot of random soldiers whose characters were a little too generic for me to remember, but it didn't take away from anything either.

The plot is overall well done. I think it has good pacing and sets up good stakes that feels appropriately difficult while the resolutions don't feel _too_ arbitrary because everything (for the most part) is well set up. My biggest complaint is that Hohenheim pulling out "actually I have my own Philospher's Stones in a circle around the country!!!" is a bit of a deus ex machina.

I finished the show wanting to see more, which is honestly a lot better than the opposite. I would love a Legend of Korra-style sequel series which explored the setting more.
